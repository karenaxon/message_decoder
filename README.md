# Message Decoder
This program creates a linked list and adds elements to it from a file with each line containing: 
<ol>
<li>a letter/character/space</li>
<li>+ a space</li>
<li>+ a number (positionof the letter/character/space in the secret message)</li>
</ol>

After the secret message has been decoded, it displays the message in plain text to standard output.
